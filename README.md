# Wardlaw's Recipe Scrapbook

### Background

Once upon a time (1981) in a land far, far away (San Francisco), a young man named Gordon Wardlaw created a scrapbook of newspaper clippings and personal notes on recipes and food journalism. Later in his career, he'd go on to write some of the foundational books on modern nutrition!

This scrapbook was found in a flea market a few years ago and was subsequently given to my wife as a gift. We knew nothing about it, other than it was a delightful curiosity. During the winter holidays, I did some research and discovered Gordon's story.

It's a large scrapbook that likely represents hundreds of hours of research and newspaper clippings throughout the course of 1981. The recipes are as diverse as they are delightful!

This project is pretty straight forward: make the scrapbook available online for free, for everyone.

### Contributing

The scrapbook has been scanned ... now it's a matter of creating an index for all of the recipes and topics in the book.
